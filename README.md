# ttt-api-test

This is a proof of concept for simple API Tic-Tac-Toe game

### Development requirements
- OO PHP
- create a Tic-Tac-Toe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game that is served over the API
- use any type of database which stores all api queries and results
- API endpoints:
  - set user name
  - list empty positions (where user can make next move)
  - post location for new O or X
  - list all active/completed games
  - retrieve any game by ID
- simple frontend to post/read from all endpoints
- must use `Trait` and `Helper`

### Process
- copy all files to your own repository
- spin-up docker
- run `npm i`
- have fun with writing the code
- commit the code to your repo
- share with us :)
